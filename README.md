# Leaflet-Challenge

## Task

The first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.
1. Get data set

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', which will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

2. Import & Visualize the Data

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
